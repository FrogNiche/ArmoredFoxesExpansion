To play it, it's important to use GeckoLib.
GeckoLib is used for the entities,
some items such as the Soul-Gauntlet,
Geomancy Hammer, and the entities' animations.

#### PlayerAnimator

PlayerAnimator is used for Player Animations, 
such as the Geomancy Hammer's attack animations(In development), 
and all the weapons in Niche's Mobs.

Both of these mods are required to play Niche's Mobs.
Example:

1. Having GeckoLib **without** PlayerAnimator will cause crashes.
2. Having PlayerAnimator **without** GeckoLib will 
crash even more than PlayerAnimator.
